        <h2>My Reflection</h2>
        <p>Embarking on the journey of UI/UX design through these projects has been both challenging and rewarding. At the beginning of this course, my understanding of UI/UX design was largely theoretical, limited to the idea of creating visually appealing interfaces. However, as I progressed through each project, I realized the depth and complexity of designing meaningful user experiences. This reflection explores my role in each project, the lessons I learned, and how my design philosophy has matured over time.</p>

        <h3>What was my role in each project? Which parts in each project did I specifically do?</h3>
        <p>My role in The Project RoboGuide was presenter and interviewer. I prepared interview questions to analyze and evaluate design, user feedback, and recommendations. I conducted interviews and recorded them for presentation purposes. I shared my evaluations and analyses with my teammate responsible for project design to assess and implement them in the process. Then, I prepared the evaluation section for the joint presentation document. Finally, we evaluated the design of our friend who created it with all our teammates.</p>
        <p>In The Project Improve The Shopping Experience, I was again a presenter and video editor. Together with my teammates, we came up with ideas on how we could improve the shopping experience in SDU Canteen. Additionally, I guided my friends about design and interview questions. Finally, after editing and finalizing all the draft documents, I edited the video and prepared the text for the presentation. Upon the advice of my teammates, I voiced the text I prepared with AI Voice and combined it with the video.</p>
        <p>In The Project Sleep Tracking App, I was a data analyst and data researcher. I was responsible for conducting user research and analysis to support the design process. This included preparing interview questions, conducting interviews with 2-3 students, and observing sleep-related habits, such as device usage. I analyzed the collected data by processing responses, identifying key insights, and highlighting critical issues. Additionally, I documented the findings by creating a comprehensive section for the final project, including a problem description, interview and observation results, and design recommendations based on the conclusions.</p>

        <h3>What did I learn from completing each project? How did that influence my approach for the next project?</h3>
        <p>Through the RoboGuide project, I learned how important it is to analyze design by gathering user feedback and understanding their needs. Previously, I relied solely on my own opinions and preferences. However, there are many different types of users, and among the most important are people with disabilities. Designs must be created to ensure they can also benefit from them easily.</p>
        <p>Through The Project Improve The Shopping Experience, I learned the importance of organizing project information and design effectively, ensuring it has a proper structure and appropriate labels. I also realized that presenting these elements in a way that impacts both the user and the project stakeholders is crucial.</p>
        <p>Through the Sleep Tracking App project, I further reinforced the importance of user feedback and needs that I learned from the RoboGuide project. Additionally, I discovered the significance of analyzing users and conducting research by asking them the right questions during interviews. This also includes highlighting critical issues effectively.</p>
        <p>In the first project, I learned the importance of user analysis, feedback, and needs. I applied this knowledge in the second project by guiding my teammate working on the Figma design to focus on common points for different types of users. From the second project, I learned the significance of project design and presentation, which I applied in the final project. During the presentation we prepared as a team, we prioritized clear visuals and concise speaking to avoid tiring or losing the attention of both investors and users as listeners and viewers.</p>

        
        <h3>How has my overall design philosophy and perspective changed over the duration of the course?</h3>
        <p>Throughout the course, my design philosophy shifted from relying on personal assumptions to embracing a user-centered approach. In RoboGuide, I learned the importance of user feedback and creating inclusive designs, especially for individuals with disabilities. The Project Improve The Shopping Experience taught me how structured, well-presented designs impact both users and stakeholders. Finally, in the Sleep Tracking App, I developed skills in user research, asking the right questions, and highlighting critical insights. Overall, I now prioritize empathy, accessibility, and effective communication in the design process.</p>

        <h3>What do I think UX and UI is now?</h3>
        <p>I now see UX and UI as essential components of creating meaningful, user-centered experiences. UX focuses on understanding users' needs, behaviors, and challenges to design solutions that are functional, accessible, and intuitive. It involves research, analysis, and iterative testing to ensure the product aligns with user expectations.</p>
        <p>UI, on the other hand, is about crafting the visual and interactive elements that bring the UX to life. It ensures the design is aesthetically pleasing, consistent, and easy to navigate. Together, UX and UI work hand in hand to create products that are not only effective and efficient but also enjoyable to use. They represent a continuous process of empathy, creativity, and problem solving.</p>
